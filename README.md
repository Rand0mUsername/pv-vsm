# pv-vsm
- A proof-of-concept compiler written as a part of my high school final-year project "Lambda calculus and functional programming"
- The source language is **PV**, a simple imperative language
- The target machine is a **virtual stack machine (VSM)** with a defined set of 16 instructions
- All compiler components were written in Haskell, with some helper codes and VSM implementation written in C++
- I expect to update this repository by the end of this year
